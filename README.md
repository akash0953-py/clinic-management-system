A **desktop-based Clinic Management System** developed using **Python, CustomTkinter, and MySQL**.
This application helps clinics efficiently manage patients, doctors, appointments, prescriptions, medicines, billing, and consultation workflows through a user-friendly graphical interface.

> This project was built as part of my learning to implement real-world **database-driven GUI applications**.
